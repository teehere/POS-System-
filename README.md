## Introduction
This project is aim to develop a **point-of-sales (POS) system** for a retail shop that can be used to generate the invoice or receipt of a transaction

## Problem
1.	**Item Master Module**
    - Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) any details of an item and save it in a text file
     
2. **Sales Module**
   - Allow the user to enter items bought by customer to the counter
   - The system should be able to capture all item codes and retrieve the description and price from Item Master
   - Once all items are captured accordingly, the user is allowed to proceed to the next process of calculating the total amount to be paid for the transaction and to round it to the nearest 5 cents
     
3. **Membership and payment process**
    - Membership for discount or reward.
    - The discount rates given based on the type of membership in which the customer is subscribed to. The membership types can be as such: Premium; Gold and Normal with a discount rate of 20%, 10% and 5% respectively
    - Customers are also allowed to choose to pay using cash, credit card or eWallet

4. **Inventory Module**
    - Upkeep of the inventory level
    - Request for items to be added when stock level falls under the safety stock level
